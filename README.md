# Poker AI
This is the readme file for the Poker AI project. First on the project, I want you to learn about how to use basic feature about Github. Try to learn about commit, issues and branches. The first week will only be about material. Try to scrape some thesis from others university. We can't understand them anyway, because if we can, maybe we should graduate. 
 
Try ur best.

# Poker AI
----------------
This is the readme file for the Poker AI project. First on the project, I want you to learn about how to use basic feature about Github. Try to learn about commit, issues, pull request and branches. The first week will only be about material. Try to scrape some thesis from others university. We can't understand them anyway, because if we can, maybe we should graduate. 
# Installation & running guide:
## Prerequisites:
This repository assumes Python 3.11 or newer is used.
Used package:

## The simple roadmap:
- [x] Simple warmup and learn to use Github
- [x] Find some material
- [x] Implement the basic UI and game structure
- [o] Implement the AI:
    - [x] Implement the evaluate function using Monte-Carlo simulations
    - [x] Implement the Monte-Carlo simulation and probability-based AI
    - [ ] Implement the Monte-Carlo tree search-based AI
    - [ ] Implement a supervised learning to improve the two mentioned above AI
    - [ ] Implement a reinforcement learning for opponent modelling in the Monte-Carlo simulations
- [x] Drink some water
- [x] Touch the grass

Try ur best.
